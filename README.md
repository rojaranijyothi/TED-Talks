# TED-Talks Recommendation system and Summarization

### 1. Background,Problem and context:

TED, which operates under the slogan 'Ideas worth spreading'  is a nonprofit devoted to spreading ideas, usually in the form of short, powerful talks (18 minutes or less). TED began in 1984 as a conference where Technology, Entertainment and Design converged, and today covers almost all topics  from science to business to global issues  in more than 100 languages. The first TED, concieved by Richard Saul Wurman,who co-founded with Harry Marks, included a demo of the compact disc, the e-book and cutting-edge 3D graphics from Lucasfilm, while mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot demonstrated how to map coastlines using his developing theory of fractal geometry.But despite a stellar lineup, the event lost money, and it was six years before Wurman and Marks tried again. 

The TED Conference became an annual event in Monterey, California, attracting a growing and influential audience from many different disciplines united by their curiosity and open-mindedness and also by their shared discovery of an exciting secret. It has been held since 1990.Back then, TED was an invitation only event. It is now you are welcome and encouraged to apply to attend.TED Talks are giving so much information and knowledge about fields that are alien to the audience and amaze them in the form of outstanding short stories,breathtaking visuals  and subtle humor. We will explore datasets containing transcripts available in www.kaggle.com of all audio-video recordings of TED Talks uploaded to the official TED.com website until September 21st, 2017. Our main goal here in this project is 
to find out the similarity between TED Talks and based on those similarities to build a recommendation system.And second one is TED Talk summarization. At the same time, our focus would be to answer the below questions from the dataset available to get meaningful derivations and inferences.


### 2. Target Clients:

These meaningful derivation, inference and results can be used by several kinds of people with different aims in mind. 

- Audience who wants to know the summary of the talk from a specific area without further going through the whole talk.
- Audience who are looking for the content relevant contextual recommendations.
- Another audience of our result can be a person looking to gain information from any TED talks from a specific area. Our result would help such people to know which talk and speaker has the most popularity in that area as a suggestive guide. It is highly likely that a popular talk will have some informative message and learnings thus the listener can be benefited most. 
- A TED talk presenter can use it to know the common topic in which people are more interested to listen and thus he can plan the topic of his talk accordingly. 
- Also, the patterns from rating data for a TED talk can help speakers to know whether their talk has been informative or confusing or ok and improve accordingly.
